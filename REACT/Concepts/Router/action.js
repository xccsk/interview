/*
when using a form in a route you can use actions to get the input of the forms and send a http request for eg. and with that you need to do this with a react specific element the Form element

u also have an object as that is passed as argument the {requests, params} object that u can use in your action form

as the loader you can also get data from an action response with the {useActionData} hook that provides the response in json to you for example on onvalid form inputs
