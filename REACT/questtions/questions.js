//1. Q:What are the features of React

/*
A: 
JSX: this is a syntax extension to JS. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX you can write HTML structure in the same file that contains JS code

Components: Components are the building blocks of any React application and single app usually consists of multiple components. It splits the user interface into independent,reusable parts that can be processed separately 

Virtual DOM: React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.

One-way data-binding: Reactâ€™s one-way data binding keeps everything modular and fast. A unidirectional data flow means that when designing a React app, you often nest child components within parent components.

High performance: React updates only those components that have changed, rather than updating all the components at once. This results in much faster web applications.
